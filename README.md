# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Analysis Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to help Bobby create a report for his manager that details the impact of the sheer number of employees that are about to start retiring from Pewlett Hackard in the next few years, or as they call it, the "Silver Tsunami". Using the data to determine which employees are going to be retirng, they also want to know which employees are at the stage in their career to be set up for mentorship from these employees. This way, Pewlett-Hackard can offset the worst impacts of the Silver Tsunami, and Bobby can best prepare to show his manager what is going to happen if nothing is done and how they could set up the mentorship program to help the current employees for future success. 

## Results
* Among the employees that have been hired between 1962 and 1965, 29414 have been senior engineers, 28254 were senior staff members, 14222 engineers, 12243 staff members, 4502 technique leaders, 1761 assistant engineers, yet only 2 managers.
* There are 1549 current employees born in 1965 that would be eligible for the mentorship program
* 90398 employees have been hired at Pewlett Hackard who were born between 1962 and 1965
* Employees born between 1962 and 1965 have been hired for 133776 roles at Pewlett-Hackard

## Summary
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
There are 90398 set to retire that will need to be replaced! Considering there 300024 employees at PH, this makes up an astonishing 30.1% of all employees that will likely be gone within the next few years!

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
Yes, considering there are only 1549 employees that are eligible to be mentored and 90398 employees set to retire, there are more than enough employees eligible to mentor. However, this means there are way too many employees that will be leaving that need to be replaced once those employees leave. PH needs to start headhunting for these positions (especially the senior engineers and senior staff members that are both set to lose nearly 30,000 employees individuall) and potentially expand the ages where mentorship positions will be available to PH employees.
