# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Analysis Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to help Bobby create a report for his manager that details the impact of the sheer number of employees that are about to start retiring from Pewlett Hackard in the next few years, or as they call it, the "Silver Tsunami". Using the data to determine which employees are going to be retirng, they also want to know which employees are at the stage in their career to be set up for mentorship from these employees. This way, Pewlett-Hackard can offset the worst impacts of the Silver Tsunami, and Bobby can best prepare to show his manager what is going to happen if nothing is done and how they could set up the mentorship program to help the current employees for future success.
